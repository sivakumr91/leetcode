## Description

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return *the **root node reference** (possibly updated) of the BST*.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

- Search for a node to remove.

- If the node is found, delete the node.

Example 1:

```

**Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
**Output:** [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
**Explanation:** Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
**Output:** [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
**Explanation:** The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** root = [], key = 0
**Output:** []

```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.

- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

- Each node has a **unique** value.

- `root` is a valid binary search tree.

- `-10^5 <= key <= 10^5`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it with time complexity `O(height of tree)`?
